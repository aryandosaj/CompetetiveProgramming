You are given a tree consisting of N nodes.
Path Length : Number of nodes in a Path.
Consider you are currently at Node X. 
You can perform the following operation.
You can choose any of its directly connected child node and go there or 
not choose any node at all and stop there.
You can not revisit a Node.
All these events are equiprobable.
Calculate expected path length for all the nodes.

It can be proved that this expected value 
can be represented as an irreducible fraction P/Q.
You have to print P∗Q−1 mod 109+7,
 where Q−1 is the inverse element of Q modulo 109+7.

Output the answer as a1 a2 a3 ..an
where ai is the expected value of path length from node i.
Input
4
1 2
2 3
2 4

Output
833333341 750000007 833333341 833333341


Explanation:

For starting node as 1

Expected length = 1/2 + 2/6 + 3/6 +3/6 = 11/6 

(11 * inverse_mod(6) )%mod =833333341

For starting node as 2

Expected length = 1/4(1 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 7/4 

(7 * inverse_mod(4) )%mod= 750000007
